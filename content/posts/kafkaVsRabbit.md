## RabbitMQ 
- supports : 
  - AMQP  : Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
  - MQTT  : MQ Telemetry Protocol
  - STOMP : Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol
- is known as a *hybrid* broker
- uses *smart broker/dumb consumer* model
  
## Kafka
- provides higher throughput, *built-in partitioning, replication, and inherent fault-tolerance*

There are 2 *async* messagin patterns :
1. Message Queue
   - a creating app sends a msg to queue. When the consuming app is ready, it just connects to the queue and retrieves the msg, removing it from the queue. 
   - several consuming apps can exist, **each message is only consumed by one**.

2. Publish/Subscribe (pub/sub) 
   - allows producers to publish msg's which can be consumed by multiple consumer.
   - if consuming apps are interested, they just subscribe to a channel
   - used when a msg or event must trigger several actions
   - unlike the message queue, pub/sub *assures* that consuming apps rcv msg's in the *same order* as messaging system received them.

## RabbitMQ Architecture
- consists of 
  - producers
  - exchanges
  - queues
  - consumers
  
 ```                         
                             queues  
            msg              |---->
  producer -----> exchange --|----> consumers
                             |---->
                           or other 
                            exchanges
  ```
- *queue* is a sequential data structure:
    - producers add to the end 
    - consumers get data from the top
    - FIFO 
- *msg exchange* determines routing
  - 4 exchange types:
    - direct 
      - can directly target msg's to a particular queue

    - fanout
      - route msg's to all available queues

## Kafka Architecture  
- consists of
  - producers
  - consumers
  - clusters
  - brokers
  - topics
  - partitions
```
producer --------> cluster -------> consumer
```

## Use cases
- Rabbit MQ
  - complex routing - route msg's among miltiple consuming apps, such as in a microservice architecture
  - legacy applications

![rabbit use cases](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Kyps08v9VSh5QwETNOVuHw.png)
- Kafka
  - high-troughput activity tracking 
  - stream processing
  - event sourcing
  - log aggregation
