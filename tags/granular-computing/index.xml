They define “Granular computing” as the collection of very short-lived (10-100 usecs) tasks. The other main properties are large scale(1k-1M cooperating tasks) and short bursts(1-10 msecs of activity). Authors discuss the challenges coming with the new concept and present a few initial ideas about the required infrastructure to support it.
In granular computing, applications are composed of a very large number of small tasks running in microsecond scale both in parallel and sequentially, spread across thousands of machines.</description></item></channel></rss>
