      <description>Summary Stoppable state machines are used to implement reconfiguration, simply a reconfigurable state machine consists of several stoppable state machines. To switch between the configurations, one is stopped and the other is started.
Traditionally, reconfiguration is done by executing special reconfiguration commands as a consensus instance. However, it prevents the concurrent execution of other commands until the new configuration is selected and ready. The main purpose of the Stoppable Paxos is to address this bottleneck.</description>
